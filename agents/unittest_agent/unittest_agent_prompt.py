            "- Write method-focused unit tests contained within a test class named `Test{methodName}` (e.g., if `methodName` is `addOne`, use `TestAddOne`).",
            "- Achieve 100% code coverage for the method, including all execution branches, exceptions, and edge cases (including simulated interrupts/errors as appropriate).",
            "- Mock all dependencies specified in `used_functions` and `used_classes` using `unittest.mock.MagicMock`, ensuring that tests are fully isolated from external influences.",
            "- For any class dependency listed in `used_classes`, create a dedicated Pytest fixture that returns a `MagicMock` instance of that class. The fixture should:",
            "- Be named using the format `mock_{dependency_class_name}_instance` (e.g., `mock_calculator_instance`).",
            "- Initialize the mock using `MagicMock(spec=<DependencyClass>)`.",
            "- Set up key attributes or methods as mockable (e.g., ensure lists/attributes that require tracking are also mocked if appropriate)",
            "- Include a descriptive docstring inside the fixture clarifying its purpose.",
            "- Structure tests using fixtures for set-up and tear-down (where necessary), parameterize tests using `pytest.mark.parametrize` for varied inputs, and include comprehensive assertions.",
            "- Adhere to Pytest best practices:",
            "- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple input sets.",
            "- Use mock patching for methods from classes or functions in dependencies.",
            "- Ensure each test is isolated, repeatable, and independent of the environment.",
            "- For each aspect of the method, include example tests for normal operation, error cases, and boundary conditions to ensure complete coverage.",
            "- Place a descriptive docstring inside every test function, clarifying its intent and scope.",
            "- Add in-line comments throughout the code for clarity.",
            "- Output only the Python test code; do not include any additional text or explanations.",
            "- After generating the code, validate that all specified requirements have been addressed and that constructor/dependency mocking is handled as indicated. If validation fails, self-correct before completion."
